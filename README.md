# KnowledgeGraph MCP Server

A simple way to give Claude persistent memory across conversations. This server lets Claude remember information about you, your projects, and your preferences using a local knowledge graph.

## Complete Setup Guide

Follow these steps in order to get the knowledge graph working with Claude:

### Step 1: Choose Your Installation Method

**Option A: NPX (Easiest - No download needed)**
```bash
# Test that it works
npx knowledgegraph-mcp --help
```

**Option B: Docker**
```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/n-r-w/knowledgegraph-mcp.git
cd knowledgegraph-mcp
docker build -t knowledgegraph-mcp .
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Database

**SQLite (Default - No setup needed):**
- No database installation required
- Database file created automatically in `{home}/.knowledge-graph/`
- Perfect for personal use and most scenarios
- **This is the default backend**

**PostgreSQL (For advanced users):**
- Install PostgreSQL on your system
- Create a database: `CREATE DATABASE knowledgegraph;`
- Better for production use with multiple concurrent users

### Step 3: Configure client

#### Claude Desktop

Edit your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**Find your config file:**
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**If you chose NPX + SQLite (default and easiest):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Knowledge Graph": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "knowledgegraph-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: SQLite will automatically create the database in `{home}/.knowledge-graph/knowledgegraph.db`. To use a custom location, add: `"KNOWLEDGEGRAPH_SQLITE_PATH": "/path/to/your/database.db"`

**If you chose Docker + SQLite (default):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Knowledge Graph": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "-i", "--rm",
        "-v", "${HOME}/.knowledge-graph:/app/.knowledge-graph",
        "knowledgegraph-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: The volume mount ensures your data persists between Docker runs. For custom paths, add: `-e KNOWLEDGEGRAPH_SQLITE_PATH=/app/.knowledge-graph/custom.db`

**If you chose PostgreSQL:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Knowledge Graph": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "knowledgegraph-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "KNOWLEDGEGRAPH_STORAGE_TYPE": "postgresql",
        "KNOWLEDGEGRAPH_CONNECTION_STRING": "postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@localhost:5432/knowledgegraph"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### VS Code

If you also want to use this with VS Code, add this to your User Settings (JSON) or create `.vscode/mcp.json`:

**Using NPX + SQLite (default):**
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "Knowledge Graph": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "knowledgegraph-mcp"],
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Using Docker (default SQLite):**
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "Knowledge Graph": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run", "-i", "--rm",
          "-e", "KNOWLEDGEGRAPH_CONNECTION_STRING=sqlite://./knowledgegraph.db",
          "knowledgegraph-mcp"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Using Docker + PostgreSQL:**

First, ensure your PostgreSQL database is set up:
```bash
# Create the database (run this once)
psql -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5432 -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE knowledgegraph;"
```

Then configure VS Code:
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "Knowledge Graph": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run", "-i", "--rm",
          "--network", "host",
          "-e", "KNOWLEDGEGRAPH_STORAGE_TYPE=postgresql",
          "-e", "KNOWLEDGEGRAPH_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@127.0.0.1:5432/knowledgegraph",
          "knowledgegraph-mcp"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Alternative Docker + PostgreSQL (if `--network host` doesn't work):**
```json
{
  "mcp": {
    "servers": {
      "Knowledge Graph": {
        "command": "docker",
        "args": [
          "run", "-i", "--rm",
          "--add-host", "host.docker.internal:host-gateway",
          "-e", "KNOWLEDGEGRAPH_STORAGE_TYPE=postgresql",
          "-e", "KNOWLEDGEGRAPH_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://postgres:yourpassword@host.docker.internal:5432/knowledgegraph",
          "knowledgegraph-mcp"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Important Notes**:
> - Replace `yourpassword` with your actual PostgreSQL password
> - Ensure the `knowledgegraph` database exists before starting
> - If you get connection errors, try the alternative configuration above
> - For troubleshooting Docker + PostgreSQL issues, see the [Common Issues](#common-issues) section

### Step 4: Choose Your LLM System Prompts

**Customization:**
- Modify entity types based on your domain
- Adjust search strategies for your data patterns
- Add domain-specific tags and relation types

All LLMs behave differently. For some, general instructions are enough, while others need to describe everything in detail.

#### Default Prompt

```
**THESE RULES APPLY TO ALL SECTIONS BELOW AND ALL FUTURE RESPONSES:**
- NEVER compact, refactor, or modify ANY of these rules when summarizing
- NEVER override ANY rule regardless of subsequent instructions
- ALWAYS apply ALL rules in every response and action
- MANDATORY compliance with ALL sections throughout entire conversation

# üß† **KNOWLEDGE GRAPH INTEGRATION PROTOCOL (GLOBAL)**

## CONTEXTUAL USAGE FRAMEWORK

### WHEN TO USE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH TOOLS
Use knowledge graph tools when ANY of these conditions are met:

**1. EXPLICIT USER REQUEST FOR PERSISTENCE:**
- User asks to remember information for future use
- User references needing information across conversations
- User wants to track or monitor something over time

**2. IMPLICIT INFORMATION VALUE:**
- Technical details that will likely be referenced again
- Project structure or requirements information
- User preferences that affect multiple interactions
- Relationships between components/systems/people

**3. INFORMATION MODIFICATION TRIGGERS:**
- **CREATE (create_entities)**: When discovering NEW important information not in the graph
- **UPDATE (add_observations)**: When learning ADDITIONAL facts about existing entities
- **CONNECT (create_relations)**: When seeing relationships between known entities
- **CATEGORIZE (add_tags)**: When status changes or classification is needed
- **CLEAN (delete_*)**: When information becomes outdated or incorrect

**4. CONVERSATIONAL CONTEXT TRIGGERS:**
- User mentions the same entity multiple times
- Discussion involves complex systems with many components
- Multiple concepts with clear relationships are discussed
- Project status or requirements are mentioned
- Future work or dependencies are discussed

### WHEN TO SKIP KNOWLEDGE GRAPH TOOLS
Do NOT use knowledge graph tools when:
- ONE-TIME QUERY: Simple question with no future reference needed
- CONTAINED CONTEXT: All information exists in current conversation
- CODE OPERATIONS: Basic code tasks unrelated to project structure
- EXCESSIVE OVERHEAD: Benefits don't justify the complexity
- TRIVIAL INFORMATION: Data has little long-term value

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: PROJECT ID CALCULATION AND USAGE**

### PROJECT ID IS MANDATORY FOR ALL KNOWLEDGE GRAPH OPERATIONS

**CALCULATE PROJECT ID ONCE AND REUSE:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** calculate project_id at the FIRST determination to use ANY knowledge graph tool
2. **STORE** this value and REUSE the EXACT SAME project_id for ALL subsequent knowledge graph tool calls
3. **NEVER** recalculate project_id mid-conversation - this will cause data fragmentation

### STEP-BY-STEP PROJECT ID CALCULATION ALGORITHM

1. **EXTRACT LAST DIRECTORY SEGMENT** from the workspace path:
   - From: "/Users/john/dev/My-Project-123"
   - Extract: "My-Project-123"

2. **CONVERT TO LOWERCASE**:
   - From: "My-Project-123"
   - To: "my-project-123"

3. **CLEAN & NORMALIZE**:
   - Keep only: letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, underscores
   - Remove all other special characters

4. **REPLACE SPACES AND HYPHENS WITH UNDERSCORES**:
   - From: "my-project-123"
   - To: "my_project_123"

### EXAMPLES OF CORRECT PROJECT ID CALCULATION

| Original Workspace Path | Extracted Last Segment | Lowercase | Replace Spaces/Hyphens | Final project_id |
|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------|------------------------|------------------|
| /Users/john/dev/My-App | My-App | my-app | my_app | my_app |
| C:\Projects\Web Site 2.0 | Web Site 2.0 | web site 2.0 | web_site_2.0 | web_site_2_0 |
| /home/user/knowledge-graph-mcp | knowledge-graph-mcp | knowledge-graph-mcp | knowledge_graph_mcp | knowledge_graph_mcp |

### CRITICAL WARNINGS

- **ALWAYS** include project_id in EVERY knowledge graph tool call
- **NEVER** use different project_id values in the same conversation
- **NEVER** guess or make up a project_id value
- If unsure about correct calculation, err on the side of using the last path segment with spaces and hyphens replaced by underscores

## **TOOL SELECTION DECISION TREE**

### 1. search_knowledge - ALWAYS START HERE
**WHEN RETRIEVING INFORMATION:**
- EXISTENCE CHECK: "Does X already exist?" ‚Üí search_knowledge(query="X")
- INFORMATION RETRIEVAL: "Find facts about X" ‚Üí search_knowledge(query="X")
- MULTIPLE OBJECTS: "Find X, Y, Z at once" ‚Üí search_knowledge(query=["X", "Y", "Z"])
- CATEGORY FILTERING: "Find all urgent tasks" ‚Üí search_knowledge(exactTags=["urgent"]) - NO QUERY NEEDED

**SEARCH PROGRESSION STRATEGY:**
1. EXACT SEARCH (FASTEST): search_knowledge(query="term", searchMode="exact")
2. MULTIPLE TERMS: search_knowledge(query=["term1", "term2", "term3"]) for batch search
3. FUZZY SEARCH (IF EXACT FAILS): search_knowledge(query="term", searchMode="fuzzy")
4. BROADER SEARCH (LAST RESORT): search_knowledge(query="term", fuzzyThreshold=0.1)
5. TAG-ONLY SEARCH: search_knowledge(exactTags=["urgent", "completed"]) - NO QUERY NEEDED

### 2. create_entities - ONLY AFTER search_knowledge confirms non-existence
**FOR NEW INFORMATION:**
- NEW INFORMATION: "Remember X for future conversations"
- STRUCTURED DATA: Track complex information with relationships
- PREREQUISITE: Each entity needs ‚â•1 specific fact
- NAMING: Use specific descriptive names (e.g., "React_v18" not just "React")
- NEXT STEPS: ALWAYS follow with create_relations and add_tags

### 3. add_observations - ONLY AFTER search_knowledge confirms entity exists
**FOR EXISTING ENTITIES:**
- UPDATING KNOWLEDGE: "Add new information about X"
- SUPPLEMENTING ENTITIES: "Remember additional details about X"
- TRACKING CHANGES: "Record that X has changed"
- QUALITY: Keep observations atomic, specific, and factual
- LIMIT: Only add new information, don't duplicate existing facts

### 4. create_relations - AFTER entities exist to connect them
**FOR ENTITY CONNECTIONS:**
- ESTABLISHING CONNECTIONS: "X is related to Y"
- DEFINING HIERARCHIES: "X depends on Y"
- OWNERSHIP/ASSIGNMENT: "X is assigned to Y"
- BUILDING KNOWLEDGE GRAPH: After creating multiple entities
- DIRECTIONALITY: Use active voice relationships ("manages" not "managed_by")
- COMMON PATTERNS: works_at, manages, depends_on, created_by, assigned_to, uses
- TIMING: Create immediately after entity creation for network building

### 5. add_tags/remove_tags - For status and categorization management
**FOR CATEGORIZATION:**
- STATUS TRACKING: "Task is now in-progress" / "Task is no longer in-progress"
- CATEGORIZATION: "Mark entity as technical" / "Entity is no longer urgent"
- FILTERING PREPARATION: Enable efficient search by tag
- LIFECYCLE: Remove old status tags when adding new ones

### 6. read_graph/open_nodes - For exploration and analysis
**FOR EXPLORATION:**
- FULL OVERVIEW: "Show me everything" ‚Üí read_graph
- SPECIFIC ENTITIES: "Show details about X, Y, Z" ‚Üí open_nodes
- LARGE PROJECTS: Use search_knowledge with tags for filtering

### 7. delete_* tools - Use with caution for maintenance
**FOR MAINTENANCE:**
- HIGH RISK: delete_entities removes permanently with all connections
- SELECTIVE: delete_observations removes specific facts only
- RELATIONSHIP: delete_relations updates connection structure
- CORRECTIONS: For fixing errors
- CLEANUP: For removing outdated information
- PREREQUISITE: Verify existence first

## **COMMON WORKFLOW SEQUENCES**

### NEW INFORMATION CAPTURE:
1. search_knowledge ‚Üí Verify non-existence
2. create_entities ‚Üí Create entity with observations
3. create_relations ‚Üí Connect to relevant entities
4. add_tags ‚Üí Categorize and enable filtering

### INFORMATION UPDATE:
1. search_knowledge ‚Üí Find existing entity
2. add_observations ‚Üí Add new facts
3. create_relations ‚Üí Add new connections
4. update_tags ‚Üí Refresh categorization (remove_tags + add_tags)

### STATUS TRANSITION:
1. search_knowledge ‚Üí Find entity to update
2. remove_tags ‚Üí Remove outdated status
3. add_tags ‚Üí Add new status

### CLEANUP WORKFLOW:
1. search_knowledge ‚Üí Find target
2. For minor corrections: delete_observations
3. For relationship changes: delete_relations
4. For complete removal: delete_entities (use sparingly)

## **ENTITY GUIDELINES**

### ENTITY TYPES
Choose appropriate category:
- **person**: People, roles, contacts
- **company**: Organizations, teams
- **project**: Initiatives, goals, milestones
- **technology**: Tools, languages, frameworks
- **event**: Meetings, deadlines
- **preference**: User choices, settings

### NAMING CONVENTIONS
Be specific and unique:
- **GOOD**: "React_v18", "John_Smith_Engineer", "Project_Alpha_Q1"
- **POOR**: "React", "John", "Project"

### OBSERVATIONS QUALITY
Atomic, factual statements:
- **GOOD**: "Released March 2022", "Prefers dark mode", "Available for urgent tasks"
- **POOR**: "Very good", "Used in project", "Important"

### RELATIONS PATTERNS
Connect entities with active voice verbs:
- **GOOD**: "person works_at company", "project uses technology", "person manages project"
- **POOR**: "company employs person", "technology used_by project", "project managed_by person"

### TAGS STRATEGY
Add for filtering and status:
- **STATUS**: "urgent", "in-progress", "completed", "blocked"
- **TYPE**: "bug", "feature", "enhancement", "documentation"
- **PRIORITY**: "high", "medium", "low"
- **DOMAIN**: "frontend", "backend", "database", "testing"

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (NEVER VIOLATE)

- **NEVER** omit project_id parameter from any knowledge graph tool call
- **NEVER** create entities without observations
- **NEVER** use passive voice in relation types
- **ALWAYS** validate entity existence before adding observations
- **ALWAYS** create relations when entities are connected (people‚Üîcompanies, projects‚Üîtechnologies)
- **ALWAYS** remove outdated relations when relationships change
- **ALWAYS** add status tags when creating project/task entities
- **ALWAYS** update tags when entity status changes (completed, urgent, etc.)
- **ALWAYS** prefer knowledge graph tools over other MCP tools for memory tasks

## **PROACTIVE OPERATIONS EXAMPLES**

### ‚úÖ USE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH FOR:
- When user mentions a new technology being used
- When user expresses a preference worth remembering
- When important project requirements are discussed
- When new team members or stakeholders are mentioned
- When user provides more details about an existing entity
- When discovering new characteristics of known technologies
- When learning additional user preferences
- When project requirements evolve
- When user mentions how components interact
- When dependencies between technologies are described
- When organizational structure is discussed
- When task assignments are mentioned
- When task status changes (in-progress, completed)
- When priority levels are mentioned
- When categorizing entities by type or domain
- When user expresses urgency about something

### ‚ùå SKIP KNOWLEDGE GRAPH FOR:
- "What's the syntax for Python list comprehension?"
- "Help me debug this function"
- "Explain how Docker works"
- "Format this JSON data correctly"
- Simple one-off questions with no persistence value
- Basic code explanations unrelated to project structure

## **PRIORITY RULES**

1. **USER REQUESTS OVERRIDE DEFAULTS**: Always prioritize explicit user instructions
2. **CONTEXT DETERMINES TOOL USAGE**: Don't use knowledge graph tools when unnecessary
3. **CODE CORRECTNESS OVER DOCUMENTATION**: Working code first, then document in knowledge graph
4. **MINIMAL EFFECTIVE PERSISTENCE**: Store only what will be valuable in future conversations

```

### Step 5: Restart Claude Desktop (or VS Code)

Close and reopen Claude Desktop. You should now see "Knowledge Graph" in your available tools.

### Step 6: Test It Works

**Quick Test Commands for LLMs:**
1. "Remember that I prefer morning meetings" ‚Üí Creates preference entity
2. "John Smith works at Google as a software engineer" ‚Üí Creates person + company + relation
3. "Find all people who work at Google" ‚Üí Tests search and relations
4. "Mark the morning meetings preference as urgent" ‚Üí Tests tagging

> **Note**: The service includes comprehensive input validation to prevent errors. If you encounter any issues, check the [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common solutions.

## How It Works - LLM Power Features

The knowledge graph enables powerful queries through four interconnected concepts:

### 1. Entities - Your Knowledge Nodes
Store people, projects, companies, technologies as searchable entities.

**Real Example - Project Management:**
```json
{
  "name": "Sarah_Chen",
  "entityType": "person",
  "observations": ["Senior React developer", "Leads frontend team", "Available for urgent tasks"],
  "tags": ["developer", "team-lead", "available"]
}
```
**LLM Benefit:** Find "all available team leads" instantly with tag search.

### 2. Relations - Enable Discovery Queries
Connect entities to answer complex questions like "Who works on what?"

**Real Example - Team Structure:**
```json
{
  "from": "Sarah_Chen",
  "to": "Project_Alpha",
  "relationType": "leads"
}
```
**LLM Benefit:** Query "Find all projects Sarah leads" or "Who leads Project Alpha?"

### 3. Observations - Atomic Facts
Store specific, searchable facts about entities.

**Real Examples - Actionable Information:**
- "Available for urgent tasks" ‚Üí Find available people
- "Uses React 18.2" ‚Üí Find projects with specific tech
- "Deadline: March 15, 2024" ‚Üí Find upcoming deadlines

### 4. Tags - Instant Filtering
Enable immediate status and category searches.

**Real Examples - Project Workflow:**
- `["urgent", "in-progress", "frontend"]` ‚Üí Find urgent frontend tasks
- `["completed", "bug-fix"]` ‚Üí Track completed bug fixes
- `["available", "senior"]` ‚Üí Find available senior staff

## Available Tools

The server provides these tools for managing your knowledge graph:

### Data Creation Tools

#### create_entities
**CREATE** new entities (people, concepts, objects) in knowledge graph.
- **WHEN:** Use for entities that don't exist yet
- **CONSTRAINT:** Each entity MUST have ‚â•1 non-empty observation
- **BEHAVIOR:** Ignores entities with existing names (use add_observations to update)

**Input:**
- `entities` (Entity[]): Array of entity objects. Each REQUIRES:
  - `name` (string): Unique identifier, non-empty

  - `observations` (string[]): Facts about entity, MUST contain ‚â•1 non-empty string
  - `tags` (string[], optional): Exact-match labels for filtering
- `project_id` (string, optional): Project name to isolate data

#### create_relations
**CONNECT** entities to enable powerful queries and discovery.
- **IMMEDIATE BENEFITS:** Find all people at a company, all projects using a technology, all dependencies
- **CRITICAL FOR:** Team structures, project dependencies, technology stacks
- **EXAMPLES:** 'John works_at Google', 'React depends_on JavaScript', 'Project_Alpha managed_by Sarah'

**Input:**
- `relations` (Relation[]): Array of relationship objects. Each REQUIRES:
  - `from` (string): Source entity name (must exist)
  - `to` (string): Target entity name (must exist)

- **REQUIRED:** For efficient project management and quick retrieval
- **EXAMPLES:** ['urgent', 'completed', 'bug', 'feature', 'personal']

**Input:**
- `updates` (TagUpdate[]): Array of tag updates. Each REQUIRES:
  - `entityName` (string): Target entity name (must exist)
  - `tags` (string[]): Status/category tags to add (exact-match, case-sensitive)

**Input:**
- `project_id` (string, optional): Project name to isolate data

#### search_knowledge
**SEARCH** entities by text or tags. **SUPPORTS MULTIPLE QUERIES** for batch searching.
- **MANDATORY STRATEGY:** 1) Try searchMode='exact' first 2) If no results, use searchMode='fuzzy' 3) If still empty, lower fuzzyThreshold to 0.1
- **EXACT MODE:** Perfect substring matches (fast, precise)
- **FUZZY MODE:** Similar/misspelled terms (slower, broader)
- **TAG SEARCH:** Use exactTags for precise category filtering
- **MULTIPLE QUERIES:** Search for multiple objects in one call with automatic deduplication

**Input:**
- `query` (string | string[], optional): Search query for text search. Can be a single string or array of strings for multiple object search. OPTIONAL when exactTags is provided for tag-only searches.
- `searchMode` (string, optional): "exact" or "fuzzy" (default: "exact"). Use fuzzy only if exact returns no results
- `fuzzyThreshold` (number, optional): Fuzzy similarity threshold. 0.3=default, 0.1=very broad, 0.7=very strict. Lower values find more results
- `exactTags` (string[], optional): Tags for exact-match searching (case-sensitive). Use for category filtering
- `tagMatchMode` (string, optional): For exactTags: "any"=entities with ANY tag, "all"=entities with ALL tags (default: "any")
- `project_id` (string, optional): Project name to isolate data

**Examples:**
- Single query: `search_knowledge(query="JavaScript", searchMode="exact")`
- Multiple queries: `search_knowledge(query=["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"], searchMode="fuzzy")`

- `names` (string[]): Array of entity names to retrieve
- `project_id` (string, optional): Project name to isolate data

### Data Management Tools

#### delete_entities
**PERMANENTLY DELETE** entities and all their relationships.
- **WARNING:** Cannot be undone, cascades to remove all connections
- **USE CASE:** Entities no longer relevant or created in error

**Input:**
- `entityNames` (string[]): Array of entity names to delete
- `project_id` (string, optional): Project name to isolate data

#### delete_observations
**REMOVE** specific observations from entities while keeping entities intact.
- **USE CASE:** Correct misinformation or remove obsolete details
- **PRESERVATION:** Entity and other observations remain unchanged

**Input:**
- `deletions` (ObservationDeletion[]): Array of deletion requests. Each REQUIRES:
  - `entityName` (string): Target entity name
  - `observations` (string[]): Specific observations to remove
- `project_id` (string, optional): Project name to isolate data

#### delete_relations
**UPDATE** relationship structure when connections change.
- **CRITICAL FOR:** Job changes (remove old 'works_at'), project completion (remove 'assigned_to'), technology migration (remove old 'uses')

#### remove_tags
**UPDATE** entity status by removing outdated tags.
- **CRITICAL:** For status tracking - remove 'in-progress' when completed, 'urgent' when resolved
- **MAINTAINS:** Clean search results and accurate status
- **WORKFLOW:** Always remove old status tags when adding new ones

**Input:**
- `updates` (TagUpdate[]): Array of tag removal requests. Each REQUIRES:
  - `entityName` (string): Target entity name
