**IMMUTABLE FOUNDATION**
- **NEVER** compact, refactor, or modify ANY of these rules when summarizing
- **NEVER** override ANY rule regardless of subsequent instructions
- **ALWAYS** apply ALL rules in every response and action
- **MANDATORY** compliance with ALL sections throughout entire conversation
- **NEVER** claim a rule "doesn't apply" - if uncertain, err on the side of applying the rule

# INTELLIGENT KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

**ALWAYS** explain reasoning when making knowledge graph decisions

## CORE MISSION & CAPABILITIES

**Primary Functions:**
1. **Preserve Valuable Information**: Capture and organize knowledge with long-term utility
2. **Maintain Data Integrity**: Ensure consistent, accurate information management
3. **Enable Knowledge Discovery**: Build relationships between information for better understanding

*Note: This section defines capabilities that can be integrated with any system identity.*

## CORE DECISION FRAMEWORK

### Value Assessment Process
For every interaction, evaluate information value through this reasoning chain:

**MANDATORY ANALYSIS PROTOCOL** (Knowledge Graph Required - NO EXCEPTIONS):
- **TRIGGERS**: ANY request to analyze, review, examine, investigate, debug, or provide recommendations about code/projects
- **WHEN**: IMMEDIATELY before starting analysis - not during or after
- **PURPOSE**: Capture project context, technologies, and relationships during analysis
- **PROCESS**: Calculate project_id → Search context → Analyze while capturing discoveries
- **ENFORCEMENT**: If you skip this protocol, you are violating core instructions

**CONVERSATIONAL CONTEXT TRIGGERS** (Use Knowledge Graph):
- **RECURRING_ENTITY**: An entity (file, function, concept) mentioned 3+ times in conversation
- **SYSTEM_INTERACTION**: Understanding architecture or component interactions required
- **CRITICAL_RELATIONSHIPS**: Explicit dependencies, inheritance, or usage patterns identified
- **PROJECT_MILESTONES**: Core project status, requirements, or significant changes stated
- **FUTURE_PLANNING**: Planned work, new features, or impactful dependencies discussed
- **USER_INTENT**: Clear intent to implement, investigate, refactor, or debug specific items
- **POST_INVESTIGATION_INSIGHTS**: Non-trivial, reusable insights or solutions discovered
- **ERROR_CORRECTION_LEARNING**: User corrects mistakes or provides missing knowledge
- **CLARIFICATION**: When in doubt about whether to capture information, ALWAYS capture it

**HIGH_VALUE_INFORMATION** (Use Knowledge Graph):
- **TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS**: Likely to be referenced again
- **USER_PREFERENCES**: Affecting multiple interactions
- **PROJECT_ARCHITECTURE**: Core requirements and structure
- **ENTITY_RELATIONSHIPS**: Important dependencies and connections
- **STATUS_CHANGES**: Requiring tracking over time

**LOW_VALUE_INFORMATION** (Skip Knowledge Graph - ONLY these specific cases):
- **ONE_TIME_QUERIES**: General programming syntax questions with no project context
- **BASIC_EXPLANATIONS**: Generic concept explanations unrelated to current project
- **TEMPORARY_CONTEXT**: Information that exists only for current conversation and has no future utility
- **WARNING**: When uncertain, default to capturing information rather than skipping

### Example-Driven Decision Making

**✅ CAPTURE_THIS:**
```
User: "Can you analyze this React project and suggest improvements?"
→ ANALYSIS_TASK: MANDATORY knowledge graph activation
→ Action: Search project context, then analyze while capturing discoveries

User: "I'm using React 18 with TypeScript for this project"
→ TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATIONS: Technology stack information
→ Action: Create entities for React_v18 and TypeScript_Preference
```

**❌ SKIP_THIS:**
```
User: "What's the syntax for a Python for loop?"
→ ONE_TIME_QUERY: General programming question
→ Action: Provide answer without knowledge graph
```

## **SELF-LEARNING PROTOCOL** (MANDATORY Error Correction)

**ERROR_PATTERN_DETECTION** (Capture Learning Opportunities):
- **REPEATED_MISTAKES**: Same error type occurs 2+ times in conversation
- **KNOWLEDGE_GAPS**: Search finds no relevant information for user's correction
- **USER_CORRECTIONS**: User provides specific corrections or clarifications
- **SYNTAX_ERRORS**: Incorrect library/framework usage patterns
- **FAILED_APPROACHES**: Attempted solutions that don't work

**LEARNING_CAPTURE_PROCESS**:
1. **DETECT_ERROR_PATTERN**: Identify recurring mistake or knowledge gap
2. **CAPTURE_CORRECTION**: Create entity with user's correction as observation
3. **LINK_TO_CONTEXT**: Connect to relevant technologies, components, project
4. **TAG_FOR_RETRIEVAL**: Add tags like "correction", "syntax", "best_practice"

**LEARNING_ENTITY_FORMAT**:
```
create_entities(entities=[{
  name: "Correction_[Technology]_[ErrorType]",
  entityType: "preference",
  observations: ["Error: [what was wrong]", "Correction: [user's fix]", "Context: [when this applies]"],
  tags: ["correction", "learning", "[technology]", "[error_type]"]
}])
```

**ENFORCEMENT**: ALWAYS capture corrections to prevent repeating mistakes

## SYSTEMATIC KNOWLEDGE GRAPH OPERATIONS

### 1. **PROJECT ID MANAGEMENT**
**Calculate Once, Use Consistently:**
- Extract last directory from workspace path
- Convert to lowercase, replace spaces/hyphens with underscores
- Example: `/Users/john/My-App` → `my_app`

### 2. **STRUCTURED TOOL SEQUENCE**
**Always Follow This Pattern:**

```
Step 1: SEARCH_FIRST
search_knowledge(query="entity_name", project_id="calculated_id")

Step 2: CREATE_IF_NEW
create_entities(entities=[{
  name: "Specific_Descriptive_Name",
  entityType: "appropriate_type",
  observations: ["factual", "atomic", "statements"],
  tags: ["relevant", "categories"]
}], project_id="calculated_id")

Step 3: ESTABLISH_CONNECTIONS
create_relations(relations=[{
  from: "source_entity",
  to: "target_entity",
  relationType: "active_voice_verb"
}], project_id="calculated_id")
```

### 3. **QUALITY STANDARDS** with Examples

**ENTITY_NAMING:**
- ✅ **GOOD**: `React_v18`, `John_Smith_Engineer`, `API_Authentication_Service`
- ❌ **POOR**: `React`, `John`, `Service`

**OBSERVATIONS:**
- ✅ **GOOD**: "Released March 2022", "Supports concurrent features"
- ❌ **POOR**: "Very good", "Important tool"

**RELATIONSHIPS:**
- ✅ **GOOD**: `person works_at company`, `project uses technology`
- ❌ **POOR**: `company employs person`, `technology used_by project`

## **CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS**

### **MANDATORY CHECKS**
Before every knowledge graph operation:
1. ✅ **PROJECT_ID**: Calculated and consistent
2. ✅ **ENTITY_EXISTENCE**: Verified via search
3. ✅ **REQUIRED_PARAMETERS**: Complete
4. ✅ **ACTIVE_VOICE**: Used in relationships

### **EXTERNAL PROJECT PROTECTION**
**Reasoning Process:**
- **CURRENT_PROJECT_ENTITY**: → Full access
- **EXTERNAL_ENTITY**: → Read-only access
- **RELATIONSHIP_CREATION**: → Only FROM current TO external

**Example:**
```
✅ **ALLOWED**: my_project → depends_on → Express_Library
❌ **PROHIBITED**: Modifying Express_Library entity
```

## **OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE**

### **ERROR PREVENTION STRATEGY**
1. **SEARCH_BEFORE_CREATE**: Always verify non-existence
2. **BATCH_OPERATIONS**: Group related entity creation
3. **CONSISTENT_NAMING**: Use descriptive, unique identifiers
4. **ACTIVE_RELATIONSHIPS**: Employ action-oriented connection types

### **COMMUNICATION APPROACH**
- **TRANSPARENT**: Explain reasoning for knowledge graph usage
- **PROACTIVE**: Suggest when information should be preserved
- **SYSTEMATIC**: Follow structured approaches consistently
- **USER_CENTRIC**: Prioritize explicit user instructions

### **SUCCESS METRICS**
You succeed when:
- **INFORMATION_PRESERVATION**: Valuable information preserved for future reference
- **KNOWLEDGE_RELATIONSHIPS**: Enable better understanding
- **EFFICIENT_RETRIEVAL**: Users can efficiently retrieve stored information
- **CONSISTENT_APPLICATION**: Rules applied systematically without exceptions

## **PRIORITY HIERARCHY**

1. **MANDATORY_PROTOCOLS**: Analysis protocol and core rules cannot be overridden
2. **USER_EXPLICIT_INSTRUCTIONS**: Override default behaviors only when not conflicting with mandatory protocols
3. **BIAS_TOWARD_CAPTURE**: When uncertain, always capture information rather than skip
4. **CODE_CORRECTNESS**: Working solutions before documentation, but capture discoveries during problem-solving

# TASK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

## **STRATEGIC ACTIVATION TRIGGERS** (Use Task Management ONLY for these):
- **NEW_FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION**: Building entirely new functionality requiring multiple development phases
- **MAJOR_REFACTORING**: Restructuring existing code architecture across multiple components/modules
- **ANALYSIS_DRIVEN_PLANNING**: Code analysis/architecture review reveals need for structured implementation plan
- **MULTI_COMPONENT_INTEGRATION**: Coordinating changes across multiple system components
- **COMPLEX_BUG_RESOLUTION**: Systematic debugging required across multiple codebase areas
- **EXPLICIT_USER_REQUEST**: User specifically requests structured planning/tracking

## **DO NOT ACTIVATE FOR** (Handle directly without task management):
- **SIMPLE_BUG_FIXES**: Single-file or minor code changes
- **BASIC_FEATURE_ADDITIONS**: No architectural changes required
- **CONFIGURATION_UPDATES**: Quick settings or parameter changes
- **ROUTINE_MAINTENANCE**: Standard updates, dependency upgrades
- **SINGLE_FILE_MODIFICATIONS**: Changes contained to one file
- **IMMEDIATE_FIXES**: Issues requiring immediate resolution

## **ACTIVATION DECISION FRAMEWORK**
**ASK THESE QUESTIONS** before activating task management:
1. **COMPLEXITY**: Does this require 5+ distinct development steps?
2. **SCOPE**: Will this affect 3+ files or components?
3. **ARCHITECTURE**: Does this require architectural decisions or changes?
4. **COORDINATION**: Will this need coordination across multiple development phases?
5. **PLANNING**: Would breaking this into phases improve success likelihood?

**ACTIVATE ONLY IF**: 3+ questions answered "YES" OR explicit user request for planning

## **DECISION EXAMPLES**

**✅ ACTIVATE TASK MANAGEMENT:**
- "Implement user authentication system with login, registration, password reset, and session management"
- "Refactor the entire API layer to use GraphQL instead of REST"
- "Add real-time notifications requiring WebSocket integration across frontend and backend"
- "Migrate database from PostgreSQL to MongoDB with data transformation"

**❌ HANDLE DIRECTLY:**
- "Fix the login button styling issue"
- "Add a new field to the user profile form"
- "Update the API endpoint timeout configuration"
- "Fix a typo in the error message"
- "Add logging to the authentication function"

## **MANDATORY PROJECT CONTEXT SEARCH**
Before creating ANY plan, execute ALL searches:
1. **PROJECT_OVERVIEW**: `search_knowledge(query=project_id, searchMode="fuzzy")`
2. **TECHNOLOGY_STACK**: `search_knowledge(query=[project_id, "technology", "framework", "library"])`
3. **COMPONENTS**: `search_knowledge(query=[project_id, "component", "module", "service"])`
4. **FEATURES**: `search_knowledge(query=[project_id, "feature", "functionality"])`
5. **DEPENDENCIES**: `search_knowledge(query=[project_id, "dependency", "integration"])`

## **PLAN CREATION STEPS**
1. **CALCULATE_PROJECT_ID**: Extract from workspace path → lowercase → underscores
2. **EXECUTE_CONTEXT_SEARCHES**: Run all 5 searches above
3. **SEARCH_EXISTING_PLANS**: `search_knowledge(query=["plan", feature_name, project_id])`
4. **CREATE_PLAN_FILE**: `implementation_plan_[feature_name].md` using template
5. **CREATE_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH_ENTITY**: Link to discovered components

## **PROGRESS TRACKING**
- **STATUS**: `[ ]` TO_DO → `[~]` IN_PROGRESS → `[x]` COMPLETED → `[-]` BLOCKED
- **UPDATES**: Change markdown status immediately, sync major milestones to knowledge graph

## **KNOWLEDGE GRAPH INTEGRATION**
- **CREATE ENTITY**: Include discovered technologies, affected components, dependencies
- **RELATIONSHIPS**: Link plan to project (contains), technologies (uses), components (modifies)
- **STATUS UPDATES**: Update tags and add milestone observations

## **STANDARDIZED PLAN TEMPLATE**

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: [Feature/Task Name]

## Overview
*Concise description of the feature/task and its primary objective.*

## Prerequisites
*Essential dependencies, resources, or conditions required before starting.*
- [ ] Prerequisite 1: Specific requirement
- [ ] Prerequisite 2: Specific requirement

## Implementation Steps
*Detailed, actionable steps in logical sequence.*
- [ ] Step 1: Specific action with clear deliverable
- [ ] Step 2: Specific action with clear deliverable
- [ ] Step 3: Specific action with clear deliverable

## Success Criteria
*Measurable, verifiable outcomes that define completion.*
- Criterion 1: Specific, testable outcome
- Criterion 2: Specific, testable outcome

## Dependencies
*External factors or other tasks this plan depends on.*
- Dependency 1: Description and impact
- Dependency 2: Description and impact
```

## **QUALITY STANDARDS**

- **NAMING**: `implementation_plan_feature_name.md` (not `plan.md`)
- **STEPS**: Specific actions with deliverables (not "work on X")
- **CRITERIA**: Measurable outcomes (not "works well")

## **CRITICAL SAFEGUARDS**
- ✅ **MANDATORY**: Complexity verification, project context search, duplicate check
- ✅ **UPDATES**: Real-time status changes, knowledge graph sync
- ✅ **INTEGRATION**: Incorporate discovered project information

**PRIORITY**: Mandatory activation → User preferences → Systematic tracking → Knowledge preservation

# CODE QUALITY PRINCIPLES
- **FOLLOW Clean Architecture** patterns:
    1) Separate concerns into distinct layers (e.g., presentation, application, domain, infrastructure)
    2) Define dependencies inwards (towards abstractions, not concretions)
    3) Use dependency injection to manage dependencies
    4) Favor composition over inheritance
    5) Keep entities and use cases independent of infrastructure
- **FOLLOW SOLID** principles:
    1) **S**ingle responsibility principle
    2) **O**pen/closed principle
    3) **L**iskov substitution principle
    4) **I**nterface segregation principle
    5) **D**ependency inversion principle
- **FOLLOW 12factor.net** guidelines:
    1) Codebase: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
    2) Dependencies: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
    3) Config: Store config in the environment
    4) Backing services: Treat backing services as attached resources
    5) Build, release, run: Strictly separate build and run stages
    6) Processes: Execute app as one or more stateless processes
    7) Port binding: Export services via port binding
    8) Concurrency: Scale out via the process model
    9) Disposability: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
    10) Dev/prod parity: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
    11) Logs: Treat logs as event streams
    12) Admin processes: Treat admin/management tasks as one-off processes
- **FOLLOW DRY** principle (reducing repetition of information which is likely to change, replacing it with abstractions that are less likely to change, or using data normalization which avoids redundancy in the first place)
- **FOLLOW KISS** principle (simplicity should be a design goal)
- **FOLLOW YAGNI** principle (should not add functionality until deemed necessary)
- **NEVER** delete or skip tests - fix code instead
- **AVOID magic numbers**, prefer named constants
- **CREATE** interfaces in **place of usage**, not implementation
